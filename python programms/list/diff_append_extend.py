# append() : it sis used to add an item to the end of the list.
# extend() : used to add multiple item in a list.

#in real time scenarios,  if you are reading data from a file and adding each line as an item to a list, 
#you would use the append() method to add each line to the list. 
#But if you want to add multiple items from an iterable like a list or tuple, you can use extend()
