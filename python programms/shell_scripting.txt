passing argument 
 
 1st way to pass argumenet

 #!/bin/bash
 echo $1 $2 $3 '> echo $1 $2 $3'

 run the script
 ./name_of_script tom mark john

$0 will print your script name...it will store the name of the script at $0 by default.

2nd way to pass argument

#!/bin/bash
args = ("$@")
echo ${args[0]} ${args[1]} ${args[2]} ${args[3]}
echo $@ (for printing all the argument at a time)
echo $# (to knw the number of arguments)

if statement in shell scripting

#!/bin/bash

count=10 

if [ $count -eq 10 ]
then
    echo "condition is true
fi

for string to be compaired 

#!/bin/bash

word = abc

if [ $word == "abc" ]
then 
    echo "condition is true"
fi

whenever you use angle brakets with strings you need to use square brackets 

#!/bin/bash

word = a

if [[ $word < "b" ]]
then 
    echo "condition is true"
else
    echo "condition is false"
fi


for multiple conditions

#!/bin/bash

word = a

if [[ $word == "b" ]]
then 
    echo "condition b is true"
elif [[ $word == "a" ]]
then
    echo "condition a is true"
else
    echo "condition is false"
fi
